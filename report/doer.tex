\section{Description}
This project aims to predict and identify a \textit{DOTA 2} player based on their in-game actions using machine learning techniques.

Player identification is useful for detecting players using alternate accounts
- tracking statistics for pro players
- detect previously banned players
- use case of 'stolen' accounts, where player behaviour suddenly changes to be very different
- 'identity theft' in online amateur tournaments

Being able to predict who the player is without game knowledge allows this approach to be applicable to other games. 

Additionally, the ability to identify a player can lead to further prediction of their future actions based on their play styles and strategies, which can help build sophisticated game AI.

The goal is to first predict using different features independently, then combine them
- ideally less game specific knowledge in prediction means those features could carry over to other games
- 


Specific player on a specific hero
- what one player may do different compared to another player on the same hero






\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Primary objectives}

\subsubsection{Parse DOTA 2 replays to generate useful data such as mouse movements, gameplay statistics and strategies}

\subsubsection{Binary classification of a single player using different features independently on the same hero}

\subsubsection{Multiclass classification of players}

\subsection{Secondary objectives}

\subsubsection{Identification of patterns/strategies from a player's replays}

\subsubsection{Prediction of player actions}
