\section{Background}

\subsection{Dota 2}
\subsubsection{Overview}
Dota 2 is a popular free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Valve Corporation. In Dota 2, the player controls a single character as part of a team competing against an opponent team. Teams consist of 5 players, each controlling only their hero. The hero that the player controls is chosen from a roster of over 100 unique heroes. Each hero has their own unique abilities and characteristics, for example some heroes focus on dealing damage with spells and abilities, while other heroes use passive abilities to augment their basic attacks. To win, the team must destroy the opponent's base structure, known as the Ancient, located deep in the opponent controlled side of the map. The map is split into three lanes, with towers that must be destroyed in succession in order to remove the Ancient's invulnerability. Weaker, uncontrollable units called creeps periodically spawn from a team's Ancient and travel down the three lanes. Heroes gain experience when nearby creeps and heroes on the opposing team die. A hero then gains levels after gaining an amount of experience, which increases the hero's power and allows the player to spend a skill point on upgrading one of the hero's abilities. 

Additionally, heroes gain gold throughout a match which can be used to purchase items. Item provide powerful bonuses and abilities to a hero. Every hero has 6 slots in their inventory in which they can place purchased items. Items can also be placed in the stash or backpack, however do not provide any bonuses unless they are in one of the 6 inventory slots. Gold is gained from multiple sources, most notably by getting the killing blow on creeps, killing opponent heroes, destroying opponent buildings and passively over time.

The map in Dota 2 is asymmetrical and split in half for the two sides - Radiant and Dire. Playing on different sides leads to different strategies due to the asymmetry. There are further, more complicated mechanics in the game, such as the neutral jungle creeps and runes. However, these mechanics do not form any part of the features or data extracted in this project, and therefore their explanation is omitted. 

\subsubsection{Player control}\label{sec:dota-control}
An important aspect of Dota 2 which this project will utilise for data, is the method in which players control their characters in the game. Firstly, Dota 2 is a real time game, where player actions occur immediately. As such, players have very fine grained control of their characters. The ability to react and mechanically execute commands in order and in time plays a core part towards a player's skill in the game. Further, strategic decisions have to be made with limited time constraints and with communication with team members, making player skill in Dota 2 a combination of strategy, team work and mechanical ability.

\end{figure}

Players control their characters through the mouse and keyboard. The position of the mouse cursor is central to the way the heroes are controlled. Right-clicking in the game moves the hero to the location the mouse cursor was when the click was registered and is the primary method to control movement. Right-clicking directly on top of opponent entities such as creeps and heroes commands the player's hero to attack that entity. 

Spells and abilities are used as a combination of mouse and keyboard. The four unique abilities that each hero has is typically linked to the Q, W, E and R keys on the keyboard. Pressing the associated key activates the ability. For many abilities, the activated ability is aimed at the location of the mouse cursor. The time scale in which players have to aim their abilities vary based on player skill and situation in the game. Players with lower skill will usually allocate more time in order to aim accurately, while players with more experience may allocate less time in order to execute additional commands, such as dodging the opponent's abilities. There are also different methods of accomplishing the same command, for example right-clicking on top of opponent entities executes an attack command, but the attack command can also be executed by pressing the A key and left-clicking a position, which causes the hero to attack all opponent entities in the path towards the position. Further, many experienced players \textit{quickcast} their spells, an option that skips the aiming portion of casting an ability by immediately casting at the location of the mouse without the additional click input. 

%These different methods of play, combined with different player experience and behaviour, make interesting and possibly unique mouse movements by different players.

% This means the mouse movements of a player are based off experience, hero chosen and individual behaviour.

\subsubsection{Gameplay flow}
A match of Dota 2 can be roughly split into three distinct phases, the laning phase, mid game and end game \cite{dota-phases}. Every match varies in length, so there is no set time for when phase transitions occur. In each phase, players play slightly differently and employ different strategies, which can be influential when studying their behaviour. 

\textbf{Laning phase} \\
The laning phase is the early stage of a match where player heroes have not fully developed their levels and items. As such, the game is slower paced and heroes generally stay in their assigned lanes to gain gold and XP. Hero kills and fights do happen - especially when players move or roam to different lanes in a flank, giving their team a numbers advantage - but are less common. The laning phase is important to give teams an advantage going into the later stages of a match. 

\textbf{Mid game} \\
At some point, when each player has amassed an amount of items and hero level, teams begin to move around the map together in order to complete objectives such as pushing down towers of particular lanes. Destroying opponent towers gives a team an advantage in gold, but also allow more map control, as players can more safely traverse the opponent's side of the map. 

\textbf{Late game} \\
The late game of a match is mostly dominated by coordinated teamfights. At this point, teams are trying to break through into the opponent's base to destroy their barracks, which make their own creeps stronger. TODO destroying base

\subsection{Related work}

\subsubsection{Starcraft 2 Player Identification}
The problem of player identification based on play style and behaviour has been explored before in the game of Starcraft 2. Liu et al. \cite{starcraft-identification} first looked at using machine learning algorithms to identify a Starcraft 2 player from features extracted from match replays and followed up with further research \cite{starcraft-actions} on predicting a player's next actions based on their previous actions in the match. 

Starcraft 2 is classified as a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game, which differs in some places to Dota 2. In Starcraft, players have to manage the generation of resources, production of buildings and units in additional to the control of a large number of units which make up the player's army. This differs vastly from Dota 2's gameplay of controlling only a single unit (except for a few particular heroes with more complex mechanics) and more simplified economy. Furthermore, Dota 2 is played as a team game with five players on each side, whereas competitive games in Starcraft are mostly played as one versus one. However, there are also many similarities between the two games. Firstly, both games are real time, unlike many other adversarial games. This means that players must both think and act quickly as both strategy and precision of control are important factors to victory. Secondly, the mechanic in which a player controls units in both games is virtually identical - movement is controlled using mouse clicks by clicking on the position the player wishes to move to and any attack or ability commands are done by pressing the associated key and aiming at the desired location with the mouse. Finally, TODO. %first moba is mod of first starcraft

Liu et al. used a binary classification approach, focusing on a specific player in their dataset, with half the matches in their dataset coming from the same player, and the other half from other players. This method is less general, as the trained model will only be able to predict on the single player it is trained on, but boosts the accuracy of the model. Their later work \cite{starcraft-actions} extends on this binary classification to a multi-class classification, predicting out of 41 different players. Though the methodology for this extension is interesting and useful, it is still not a general model, as the model only recognises matches from the 41 players, which is a small subset compared to all possible Starcraft 2 players. Multiple machine learning models were used for evaluation, which gives a good indication of what models may perform well for player prediction and allows for comparison of the performance of the models for Starcraft and Dota, to see if any similarities can be drawn. The models they used were:
\begin{itemize}
\item J48 - C4.5 Decision Tree
\item Artificial Neural Networks
\item Adaptive Boosting
\item Random Forest
\end{itemize}
It is also interesting to see the type of features that were used. Liu et el. categorised their features used into three parts: general game information, state of the game and time that first actions were taken. The general game information contained information such as match length, winner, map name, etc. Some of these, such as game length and winner can be directly translated to a match in Dota 2 as well. Others such as the map name cannot be translated, as there is only a single map in Dota 2. The game state data used is based on the production of buildings and units in a small time slice of a match. The closest features to this in Dota 2 are the levelling order of a heroes skills and the items purchased.

\caption{Results figures extracted from \cite{starcraft-identification}}
\end{figure}

Their results show the performance of each machine learning model is dependent on the features used. For example, the ANN performed better using all features while the other models performed better using a smaller set of best features. This indicates that the model being trained should be taken into account during feature selection, as features that work well for one model do not necessarily work well for other ones. 

\subsubsection{Dota 2 win prediction}
In Dota 2, there has been much work in using data extracted from matches to predict the outcome of future or unseen matches. This involves both gameplay data and pre-game data such as the draft phase or history of a player's performance. Hodge et al. \cite{dota-mixed-rank-win} used a mix of pre-match data for the heroes picked and teams each hero is on, and in-game data of game states at different sliding window intervals as time-series data to predict the outcome of a match. The in-game data collected included the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Team damage dealt
\item Team kills
\item Team last hits
\item Team net worth
\item Team tower damage
\item Team XP gained
\end{itemize}
The two types of data were compared with two different models - Logistic Regression and Random Forest - and showed that in-game data was by far a stronger predictor, giving over 70\% accuracy in amateur and professional games whereas the pre-game data only achieved about 50\% accuracy. There was not a significant different between logistic regression and random forest, as they differed in performance, both able to outperform each other depending on the type of match (amateur or professional). 

Taking match outcome prediction further, Yang, Qin and Lei \cite{dota-yang} were able to run match outcome prediction in real-time to get the probability of winning at each minute of a match. They also drew comparisons between prior data and real-time data. For prior data, three categories of features were used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hero features - This category contained three parts: hero selection, hero attributes and hero win rate. The hero selection feature simply identifies the hero while the attributes and win rates contain statistics such as in-game hero abilities like strength, agility, intelligence and win rates specifically for one hero against another hero.
\item Player features - The player features contain data outside of the match about the player, such as their MMR (matchmaking ranking) scores and percentiles.
\item Hero-player combined features - Knowing both the hero and player, statistics about the particular player's record on the specific hero are used for this feature. This once again contains data such as average gold gained per minute, average XP gain per minute etc. 
\end{enumerate}
For real-time data, the gold, experience and deaths for each player at each minute was averaged and the difference between the two teams calculated, giving $3 \times T$ features for a match that lasts $T$ minutes. 
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c |}
\hline
 & \textbf{Hero} & \textbf{Player} & \textbf{Hero-player} & \textbf{Hero + Player + Hero-Player} \\ \hline
 Conley and Perry \cite{dota-conley} & 58.79\% & N/A & N/A & N/A \\ \hline
 Kinkade and Lim \cite{dota-kinkade} & 58.69\% & N/A & N/A & N/A \\ \hline
 Logistic Regression & 60.07\% & 55.77\% & 69.90\% & 71.49\% \\ \hline
 Neural Network & 59.53\% & 56.39\% & 69.71\% & 70.46\% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Results for prior data extracted from Yang, Qin and Lei \cite{dota-yang}. They also compared their results with results from Conley and Perry \cite{dota-conley} and Kinkade and Lim \cite{dota-kinkade}.}
\end{table}

It was found that for prior data, combining the three types of features gave better results than each feature alone, though only by a small margin. They also compared their prior data with Conley and Perry \cite{dota-conley}, whose focus was in creating an engine for hero pick recommendations based on win predictions, and with Kinkade and Lim \cite{dota-kinkade}, who also investigated combinations of in-game statistics and draft picks for prediction. (TODO unfair comparison as kinkade got 73\% for some models/combinations). As for real-time data, it was shown that data from later stages of a match were more informative compared to data from earlier stages of a match. This was because the early portions of a match are similar to most other matches, and begins to change uniquely as the match progresses.

\subsubsection{Player role classification}
Another area that was explored using Dota 2 match data is the classification of player roles. As Dota 2 is a team game, each player on the game typically fulfils a certain role in a match, similar to real life sports games like football and basketball. Gao et al. \cite{dota-gao} presented positive results in the identification of \textit{both} the hero and role that a player played using a mix of performance data and behavioural data that involved ability and item usage. Their work showed that for both roles and heroes, classification accuracies were higher when all features were used in combination together, compared to using each type of feature individually.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Results for role classification showing the combination of features performing the best \cite{dota-gao} and showing logistic regression as the best performing model \cite{dota-eggert}.}
\end{figure}

The features used by Gao et al. are very interesting as they show high correlation with the hero role, which is simplified to one of \textit{carry}, \textit{solo lane} and \textit{support} roles. This is related to the aim of this project to predict the actual player as the features indicate differences in player behaviour. Eggert et al. \cite{dota-eggert} took a further step in feature generation for role classification, constructing complex attributes using low-level data from a parsed replay of a match. This included features such as player positional movement and damage done during teamfights. However, some of these features are not as relevant, as they are able to differentiate between roles and heroes, but are not as applicable to differentiating different players on the same role or hero. Eggert et al. \cite{dota-eggert} further found that logistic regression was the best performing classifier out of multiple different classifiers - random forest classifiers, support vector machines, naive Bayes classifiers and Bayesian networks - while Gao et al. \cite{dota-gao} found very similar performance for random forest and logistic regression. As these two models have found good success, they are the first models used to test the player prediction features in this project. 

Quantitative research is not the only kind done in previous research on player roles in Dota 2. Nuangjumnong and Mitomo \cite{dota-leadership} conducted a survey on players which showed correlation between the leadership style of players and the role they played in the team. This relates to how different players choose roles and heroes based on their behavioural differences. 

\subsubsection{Other predictions TODO}
Apart from match outcomes and player role classification, a few other aspects of Dota 2 have been studied as machine learning problems. Summerville et al. \cite{dota-draft} studied the drafting phase of the game to find common trends and predict the draft sequence. In particular, because the draft sequence was described as a list of words, the models they trained used a one-hot encoding with a categorical cross-entropy loss.

Drachen et al. \cite{dota-skill} studied how team behaviour varied as a function of player skill, specifically on the movement and positioning of heroes by players as spatial-temporal data. This contrasts with most other studies, which have focused on only temporal data like the gold and XP per minute statistics mentioned above. Their dataset of matches and player were split into four tiers of skill level and showed that novice players were less likely to move and change zones to coordinate strategies compared to experienced players. Moreover, there is a clear distinction of team distance (distance between each member of the team) between the skill tiers, especially later in the match, compared to the start.

\subsubsection{Biometric mouse dynamics for user identification}
Finally, there has been a larger number of studies done in the area of using mouse dynamics to detect user identity. This is a behavioural biometric technology that analyses different mouse movement attributes, such as the velocity or curvature of the mouse cursor. A significant portion of Dota 2's gameplay revolved around the use of mouse clicks and movements, combined with occasional key presses. Bhatnagar et al. \cite{mouse-vs-keyboard} compared the use of mouse vs keyboard dynamics as a biometric technique and stated that keystroke dynamics have lower predictive accuracy, but mouse dynamics data tends to be inconsistent and error prone due to the varied hardware input devices that may work differently. It was proposed that methods which combine mouse and keyboard dynamics together would be able to alleviate their disadvantages.

The method of data extraction can be done explicity by using a predefined activity, or implicity by monitoring typical activity without a specified task \cite{mouse-dynamics}. For example, Gambao and Fred \cite{mouse-features} used a simple memory game in order to extract mouse movement data. This method allows for well-defined actions for data extraction, leading to higher consistency due to the lack of uncontrolled factors. Both spatial and temporal information were used by Gambao and Fred, showing lower error rates the longer the period of interaction was observed, though no comparison was made between using only spatial and only temporal information. The narrowed approach of using a memory game gave Gambao and Fred strong results, as they were able to obtain performance comparable to other behavioural biometric techniques of signature and voice dynamics. 

\imagefig{1\textwidth}{imgs/memory-game.png}{Memory game used by Gambao and Fred \cite{mouse-features} to extract mouse dynamics.}

Feher et al. \cite{mouse-dynamics} went further by categorising mouse movement features into distinct hierarchies.
