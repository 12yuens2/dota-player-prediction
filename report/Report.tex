\section*{Abstract}
Dota 2 is a popular, multiplayer online video game played by millions of people around the world. It is often unknown who the player behind an account is, as accounts can be shared and used by others. This presents problems with cheating in online tournaments and the unethical practice of account selling. This project explores the use of machine learning to predict who the player is through the use of behavioural features such as their mouse movements or in-game decisions. These features are extracted from match replays and two machine learning experiments were devised to understand if player identity can be detected through these behavioural features, and which features or combinations of features and machine learning models are best suited for the task. Many positive results were found for a variety of feature and model combinations, which shows the feasibility of this approach to automatically detect different players on the same account.
