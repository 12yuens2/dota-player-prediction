First meeting to discuss project. Main idea of the project is to predict who the player is in a game of DOTA based on replay data. 

** Initial plan (technical)
Start with parsing mouse movement from replays using ~clarity~ or the python replay parser to get angles/curves.

Start with the same player on the same hero using binary classification - is the player playing this hero X or not?

Further game knowledge prediction features later and predict with features both independently and combined

Other ideas:
- Predicting strategies of players
